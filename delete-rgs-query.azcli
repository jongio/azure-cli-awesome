# Mega powers to delete across subscriptions and e.g. groups without tags - USE WITH CAUTION
# Requires the Resource Graph extension (az extension add --name resource-graph)
# More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/first-query-azurecli

# This command allows you to delete resource groups, given any query against the Azure Resource Graph.
# Step to run the command:
# 1. Install Resource Graph Extension (az extension add --name resource-graph)
# 2. Make sure to input the subscriptionId you want to target `subscriptionId=<subscriptionId>`
# 2. Change the query to find the resource groups to delete e.g. `where tags !contains 'protect'`
# 3. Run the command. You will be asked to confirm each deletion.

# Description of the command:
# az graph query -q "ResourceContainers | where type == 'microsoft.resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups'| where subscriptionId == '<subscriptionId to target>' \ # Query for RGs in a specific subscription
#  | where tags !contains 'protect' \ # The condition for which RGs to return
#  | project name" | jq -r '.data[].name' \ # Returning the name of the RG and using jq to just get the name value
#  | xargs -I XXX -to az group delete -n XXX --no-wait # passing each name from the above query to 'az group delete', with the xargs '-to' args, we'll see the command and get to confirm to delete the RG

# Full command below:
#subscriptionId=<subscriptionId>
#az graph query -q "ResourceContainers | where type == 'microsoft.resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups'| where subscriptionId == '${subscriptionId}' \
# | where tags !contains 'protect' \
# | project name" | jq -r '.data[].name' \
# | xargs -I XXX -to az group delete -n XXX --no-wait
